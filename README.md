# Copy to New Project (Form)

Small demo HTML form used to configure copying a project.

## Files
- `index.html` — main form and styles (self-contained).

## How to preview
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with).
- Or serve the folder with a simple local server, e.g.:

  ```bash
  # using Python 3
  python -m http.server 8000
  # then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
  ```

## Recent edits / notes
- The **Copy to new project** dropdown has been disabled.
- The **Project name** input now uses a `placeholder="test"` instead of a prefilled value.
- The lock icon (🔒) for **Schedule mode** is placed next to the label (outside the input box).
- Fixed-duration is presented as a read-only styled box to match other controls.

## Editing
- `index.html` contains inline CSS for quick tweaks; modify the styles inside the `<style>` block.
- To add behavior (enable/disable logic, form submission), add a separate JavaScript file and include it near the end of `index.html`.

## Next suggestions
- Add client-side validation for required fields.
- Extract CSS to `style.css` if you prefer separation of concerns.
